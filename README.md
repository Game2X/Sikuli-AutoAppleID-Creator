Sikuli-AutoAppleID-Creator
==========================
[Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org "Home of the Sikuli Script project") is a screen-reading automation tool which can be hooked into with Java or Python.
This repo has a csv and sikuli script to drive iTunes and batch-create Apple IDs, inspired by http://www.enterpriseios.com/wiki/Batch_Apple_ID_Creator
Just like that predecessor, this creates IDs without a credit card, perfect for training or educational situations.

NOTE: Apple may throttle the amount of IDs you can create at once. Please see the thread on enterpriseiOS for more info. Also, this has only been tested in the US version of iTunes, please submit pull requests, or contact me with screenshots of the options!

Also, if you CAN have people put in a credit card to use the IDs you're tasked with creating, consider using [Fake](http://Fakeapp.com) on [Apple's site](https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/wa/createAppleId?localang=en_US)
